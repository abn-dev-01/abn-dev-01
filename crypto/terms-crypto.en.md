Here’s the glossary of terms for futures trading in English:

### Futures Trading Glossary:

1. **Futures Contract**  
   An agreement to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized in terms of quantity and expiration date.

2. **Underlying Asset**  
   The asset that is either delivered or used as the basis for settlement in a futures contract. This can include commodities (e.g., gold, oil), indices (e.g., S&P 500), or currencies (e.g., BTC, ETH).

3. **Expiration Date**  
   The date on which a futures contract expires and must be settled, either through cash or physical delivery of the asset.

4. **Leverage**  
   The use of borrowed funds to amplify the potential return on an investment. For example, with 10x leverage, you control a position 10 times larger than your margin. 

5. **Margin**  
   The collateral required to open and maintain a futures position. It can be of two types:
   - **Initial Margin**: The upfront collateral required to open a position.
   - **Maintenance Margin**: The minimum balance required to keep a position open.

6. **Liquidation**  
   The forced closing of a position by the exchange when a trader's margin falls below the maintenance margin level. This prevents losses from exceeding the trader’s collateral.

7. **Long Position**  
   Buying a futures contract with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will rise. The trader profits if the asset price increases.

8. **Short Position**  
   Selling a futures contract with the expectation that the price of the underlying asset will fall. The trader profits if the asset price decreases.

9. **Quotation**  
   The current price of a futures contract as quoted on the exchange.

10. **Spread**  
    The difference between the bid (buy) and ask (sell) prices. It can also refer to the price difference between futures contracts with different expiration dates.

11. **Cash-Settled Futures**  
    Futures contracts that are settled in cash, rather than physical delivery of the underlying asset. This is common in cryptocurrency markets.

12. **Physical Delivery**  
    The process of fulfilling a futures contract through the actual delivery of the underlying asset upon expiration.

13. **Contango**  
    A situation where futures prices are higher than the current (spot) price of the underlying asset, indicating expectations of future price increases.

14. **Backwardation**  
    The opposite of contango, where futures prices are lower than the current spot price, indicating expectations of future price declines.

15. **Spot Price**  
    The current price of the underlying asset in the market. Futures contracts may trade at a premium or discount to the spot price.

16. **Open Interest**  
    The total number of outstanding (unsettled) futures contracts on the market that remain open. An increase in open interest often indicates strength in the market.

17. **Tick**  
    The smallest possible price movement in a futures contract. For example, if the tick is $0.01, the minimum difference between buy and sell prices can be $0.01.

18. **Market Depth**  
    The number of buy and sell orders available at various prices for a futures contract. Deep market depth indicates high liquidity.

19. **Hedging**  
    The use of futures contracts to reduce risk from price fluctuations in the underlying asset. It’s commonly used by producers and consumers to protect against sharp price movements.

20. **Arbitrage**  
    A strategy in which traders buy and sell futures or underlying assets on different markets to take advantage of price differences and generate profit.

21. **Yield Curve**  
    A graphical representation showing the price differences of futures contracts with varying expiration dates. It can either slope upward (contango) or downward (backwardation).

### Key Considerations:
- **Risks**: Futures contracts carry a high level of risk, particularly when using leverage. Significant losses can occur.
- **Regulation**: It’s important to be aware of the rules and regulations that apply to futures trading on different exchanges and platforms.
